### Project structure

- Before we move into the topic of testing, we will modify the structure of our project to adhere to Node.js best practices.

- After making the changes to the directory structure of our project, we end up with the following structure:

├── index.js
├── app.js
├── build
│   ├── ...
├── controllers
│   └── notes.js
├── models
│   └── note.js
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── utils
│   ├── config.js
│   ├── logger.js
│   └── middleware.js  

- So far we have been using console.log and console.error to print different information from the code. 
- However, this is not a very good way to do things. Let's separate all printing to the console to it's own module utils/logger.js:

```javascript

const info = (...params) => {
  console.log(...params)
}

const error = (...params) => {
  console.error(...params)
}

module.exports = {
  info, error
}
```

- The logger has two functions, info for printing normal log messages, and error for all error messages. 

- Extracting logging into its own module is a good idea in more ways than one. 
- If we wanted to start writing logs to a file or send them to an external logging service like graylog or papertrail we would only have to make changes in one place.

- The contents of the index.js file used for starting the application gets simplified as follows:

```javascript

const app = require('./app') // the actual Express application
const http = require('http')
const config = require('./utils/config')
const logger = require('./utils/logger')

const server = http.createServer(app)

server.listen(config.PORT, () => {
  logger.info(`Server running on port ${config.PORT}`)
})
```

- The index.js file only imports the actual application from the app.js file and then starts the application. The function info of the logger-module is used for the console printout telling that the application is running.

- The handling of environment variables is extracted into a separate utils/config.js file:

```javascript

require('dotenv').config()

let PORT = process.env.PORT
let MONGODB_URI = process.env.MONGODB_URI

module.exports = {
  MONGODB_URI,
  PORT
}
```

- The other parts of the application can access the environment variables by importing the configuration module:


```javascript

const config = require('./utils/config')

logger.info(`Server running on port ${config.PORT}`)
```

- The route handlers have also been moved into a dedicated module. 
- The event handlers of routes are commonly referred to as controllers, and for this reason we have created a new controllers directory. All of the routes related to notes are now in the notes.js module under the controllers directory.

- The contents of the notes.js module are the following:

```javascript

const notesRouter = require('express').Router()
const Note = require('../models/note')

notesRouter.get('/', (request, response) => {
  Note.find({}).then(notes => {
    response.json(notes.map(note => note.toJSON()))
  })
})

notesRouter.get('/:id', (request, response, next) => {
  Note.findById(request.params.id)
    .then(note => {
      if (note) {
        response.json(note.toJSON())
      } else {
        response.status(404).end()
      }
    })
    .catch(error => next(error))
})

notesRouter.post('/', (request, response, next) => {
  const body = request.body

  const note = new Note({
    content: body.content,
    important: body.important || false,
    date: new Date()
  })

  note.save()
    .then(savedNote => {
      response.json(savedNote.toJSON())
    })
    .catch(error => next(error))
})

notesRouter.delete('/:id', (request, response, next) => {
  Note.findByIdAndRemove(request.params.id)
    .then(() => {
      response.status(204).end()
    })
    .catch(error => next(error))
})

notesRouter.put('/:id', (request, response, next) => {
  const body = request.body

  const note = {
    content: body.content,
    important: body.important,
  }

  Note.findByIdAndUpdate(request.params.id, note, { new: true })
    .then(updatedNote => {
      response.json(updatedNote.toJSON())
    })
    .catch(error => next(error))
})

module.exports = notesRouter
```

- This is almost an exact copy-paste of our previous index.js file.

- However, there are a few significant changes. At the very beginning of the file we create a new router object:

```javascript

const notesRouter = require('express').Router()

//...

module.exports = notesRouter
```

- The module exports the router to be available for all consumers of the module.

- All routes are now defined for the router object, in a similar fashion to what we had previously done with the object representing the entire application.

- It's worth noting that the paths in the route handlers have shortened. In the previous version, we had:

`app.delete('/api/notes/:id', (request, response) => {`

- And in the current version, we have:

`notesRouter.delete('/:id', (request, response) => {`

- So what are these router objects exactly? The Express manual provides the following explanation:
    *A router object is an isolated instance of middleware and routes. You can think of it as a “mini-application,” capable only of performing middleware and routing functions. Every Express application has a built-in app router.*

- The router is in fact a middleware, that can be used for defining "related routes" in a single place, that is typically placed in its own module.

- The app.js file that creates the actual application, takes the router into use as shown below:

```javascript

const notesRouter = require('./controllers/notes')
app.use('/api/notes', notesRouter)
```

- The router we defined earlier is used if the URL of the request starts with /api/notes. For this reason, the notesRouter object must only define the relative parts of the routes, i.e. the empty path / or just the parameter /:id.

- After making these changes, our app.js file looks like this:

```javascript
const config = require('./utils/config')
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const cors = require('cors')
const notesRouter = require('./controllers/notes')
const middleware = require('./utils/middleware')
const logger = require('./utils/logger')
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

logger.info('connecting to', config.MONGODB_URI)

mongoose.connect(config.MONGODB_URI, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
  .then(() => {
    logger.info('connected to MongoDB')
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    logger.error('error connection to MongoDB:', error.message)
  })

app.use(cors())
app.use(express.static('build'))
app.use(express.json())
app.use(middleware.requestLogger)

app.use('/api/notes', notesRouter)

app.use(middleware.unknownEndpoint)
app.use(middleware.errorHandler)

module.exports = app
```

- The file takes different middleware into use, and one of these is the notesRouter that is attached to the /api/notes route.

- Our custom middleware has been moved to a new utils/middleware.js module:

```javascript

const logger = require('./logger')

const requestLogger = (request, response, next) => {
  logger.info('Method:', request.method)
  logger.info('Path:  ', request.path)
  logger.info('Body:  ', request.body)
  logger.info('---')
  next()
}

const unknownEndpoint = (request, response) => {
  response.status(404).send({ error: 'unknown endpoint' })
}

const errorHandler = (error, request, response, next) => {
  logger.error(error.message)

  if (error.name === 'CastError') {
    return response.status(400).send({ error: 'malformatted id' })
  } else if (error.name === 'ValidationError') {
    return response.status(400).json({ error: error.message })
  }

  next(error)
}

module.exports = {
  requestLogger,
  unknownEndpoint,
  errorHandler
}
```

- The responsibility of establishing the connection to the database has been given to the `app.js` module. 
- The `note.js` file under the models directory only defines the Mongoose schema for notes.

```javascript

const mongoose = require('mongoose')

mongoose.set('useFindAndModify', false)

const noteSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  content: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    minlength: 5
  },
  date: {
    type: Date,
    required: true,
  },
  important: Boolean,
})

noteSchema.set('toJSON', {
  transform: (document, returnedObject) => {
    returnedObject.id = returnedObject._id.toString()
    delete returnedObject._id
    delete returnedObject.__v
  }
})

module.exports = mongoose.model('Note', noteSchema)
```

- To recap, the directory structure looks like this after the changes have been made:

├── index.js
├── app.js
├── build
│   ├── ...
├── controllers
│   └── notes.js
├── models
│   └── note.js
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── utils
│   ├── config.js
│   ├── logger.js
│   └── middleware.js  

- For smaller applications the structure does not matter that much. 
- Once the application starts to grow in size, you are going to have to establish some kind of structure, and separate the different responsibilities of the application into separate modules. 
- This will make developing the application much easier.

- There is no strict directory structure or file naming convention that is required for Express applications. To contrast this, Ruby on Rails does require a specific structure. Our current structure simply follows some of the best practices you can come across on the internet.

### Testing Node applications

- We have completely neglected one essential area of software development, and that is automated testing.

- Let's start our testing journey by looking at unit tests. The logic of our application is so simple, that there is not much that makes sense to test with unit tests. 
- Let's create a new file utils/for_testing.js and write a couple of simple functions that we can use for test writing practice:

```javascript

const palindrome = (string) => {
  return string
    .split('')
    .reverse()
    .join('')
}

const average = (array) => {
  const reducer = (sum, item) => {
    return sum + item
  }

  return array.reduce(reducer, 0) / array.length
}

module.exports = {
  palindrome,
  average,
}
```

- The average function uses the array reduce method. If the method is not familiar to you yet, then now is a good time to watch the first three videos from the Functional Javascript series on Youtube.

- There are many different testing libraries or test runners available for JavaScript. 
- In this course we will be using a testing library developed and used internally by Facebook called jest, that resembles the previous king of JavaScript testing libraries Mocha. 
  - Other alternatives do exist, like ava that has gained popularity in some circles.

  - Jest is a natural choice for this course, as it works well for testing backends, and it shines when it comes to testing React applications. 
    - Windows users: Jest may not work if the path of the project directory contains a directory that has spaces in its name.

- Since tests are only executed during the development of our application, we will install jest as a development dependency with the command:

`npm install --save-dev jest`

- Let's define the npm script `test` to execute tests with Jest and to report about the test execution with the verbose style:

```javascript

{
  //...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon index.js",
    "build:ui": "rm -rf build && cd ../../../2/luento/notes && npm run build && cp -r build ../../../3/luento/notes-backend",
    "deploy": "git push heroku master",
    "deploy:full": "npm run build:ui && git add . && git commit -m uibuild && git push && npm run deploy",
    "logs:prod": "heroku logs --tail",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "test": "jest --verbose"  },
  //...
}
```

- Jest requires one to specify that the execution environment is Node. This can be done by adding the following to the end of package.json:

```javascript

{
 //...
 "jest": {
   "testEnvironment": "node"
 }
}
```

- Alternatively, Jest can look for a configuration file with the default name jest.config.js, where we can define the execution environment like this:

```javascript

module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: 'node',
};
```

- Let's create a separate directory for our tests called tests and create a new file called palindrome.test.js with the following contents:

```javascript

const palindrome = require('../utils/for_testing').palindrome

test('palindrome of a', () => {
  const result = palindrome('a')

  expect(result).toBe('a')
})

test('palindrome of react', () => {
  const result = palindrome('react')

  expect(result).toBe('tcaer')
})

test('palindrome of releveler', () => {
  const result = palindrome('releveler')

  expect(result).toBe('releveler')
})
```

- The ESLint configuration we added to the project in the previous part complains about the `test` and `expect` commands in our test file, since the configuration does not allow globals. 

- Let's get rid of the complaints by adding "jest": true to the env property in the .eslintrc.js file.

```javascript

module.exports = {
  "env": {
    "commonjs": true 
    "es6": true,
    "node": true,
    "jest": true,  },
  "extends": "eslint:recommended",
  "rules": {
    // ...
  },
};
```

- In the first row, the test file imports the function to be tested and assigns it to a variable called `palindrome`:

`const palindrome = require('../utils/for_testing').palindrome`

- Individual test cases are defined with the test function. 
- The first parameter of the function is the test description as a string. 
- The second parameter is a function, that defines the functionality for the test case. 
- The functionality for the second test case looks like this:

```javascript

() => {
  const result = palindrome('react')

  expect(result).toBe('tcaer')
}
```

- First we execute the code to be tested, meaning that we generate a palindrome for the string react. 
- Next we verify the results with the expect function. 
- Expect wraps the resulting value into an object that offers a collection of matcher functions, that can be used for verifying the correctness of the result. 
- Since in this test case we are comparing two strings, we can use the toBe matcher.

- As expected, all of the tests pass:

- Jest expects by default that the names of test files contain .test. In this course, we will follow the convention of naming our tests files with the extension .test.js.

- Jest has excellent error messages, let's break the test to demonstrate this:

- Running the tests above results in the following error message:

- Let's add a few tests for the average function, into a new file tests/average.test.js.

```javascript

const average = require('../utils/for_testing').average

describe('average', () => {
  test('of one value is the value itself', () => {
    expect(average([1])).toBe(1)
  })

  test('of many is calculated right', () => {
    expect(average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])).toBe(3.5)
  })

  test('of empty array is zero', () => {
    expect(average([])).toBe(0)
  })
})
```

- The test reveals that the function does not work correctly with an empty array (this is because in JavaScript dividing by zero results in NaN):
